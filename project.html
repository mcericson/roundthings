        <h1>Round Things</h1>

        <h2>If we construct a material circle, measure its radius and circumference, and see if the ratio of these two
                lengths is equal to π , what shall we have done? We shall have made an experiment on the properties of
                the matter with which we constructed this round thing, and of that which the measure used was made.
                (Henri Poincaré, Science and Hypothesis, 1902)
        </h2>


        <p><br>The circle is perhaps one of the most iconic geometric figures in the history of drawing. Its prominent
                position in Euclid’s Elements ensured its appearance in treatise on drawing and geometry. And yet the
                circle, like all geometry, cannot be realized in material form. We can describe it as, Henri Poincaré
                points out, by the ratio of its radius and its circumference. We can also make a rough material
                approximation, a “round thing”, with a compass, a string, a computer or a numerically controlled cutting
                device. Regardless of the relative precision or sophistication of a digital or analog device, a true
                circle cannot be visualized or fabricated. Instead, we are left with “round things” that have the
                appearance of circles but are in fact not. <br><br><i>roundThings()</i> is a custom interactive software that uses the
                approximation of circular geometry and lighting to generate an endless configuration of round objects.
                The installation consists of a projected real-time interactive software written in javascript and glsl,
                a floor drawing that demarcates the zone of interaction, and a webcam that uses a machine learning
                algorithm to translated human gestures into the motion of a continuously orbiting light source. The
                light influences the rendering of the surface in both hatching and contouring, but also changes the
                shape of the round thing. Every round thing within the software is constantly approximating another more
                precise geometry that can never described in material form. The projected images are precise
                miscalculations of ideal geometries. There are no spheres or circles, only round things rendered in the
                material of which “the measure was made”—pixels.
