        <h4>If we construct a material circle, measure its radius and circumference, and see if the ratio of these two
                lengths is equal to π , what shall we have done? We shall have made an experiment on the properties of
                the matter with which we constructed this round thing, and of that which the measure used was made.
                (Henri Poincaré, Science and Hypothesis, 1902)
        </h4>

        <p>The circle is perhaps one of the most iconic geometric figures in the history of architecture. Its prominent
                position in Euclid’s Elements ensured its appearance in key architectural treatise on drawing and
                geometry. It defines the organization of centrally planned architecture. Its three-dimensional
                extension—the sphere—is the underlying geometry of the dome. Furthermore, the use of the circle to
                rotate dimensions into “true” length is one of the most fundamental aspects of orthographic projection
                and descriptive geometry. And yet the circle, like all geometry, cannot be realized in material form. We
                can describe it as, Poincaré points out, by the ratio of its radius and its circumference. We can also
                make a rough material approximation, a “round thing”, with a compass, a string, a computer or a
                numerically controlled cutting device. Regardless of the relative precision or sophistication of a
                particular device of fabrication, a true circle cannot be fabricated. Instead, we are left with “round
                things” that have the appearance of circles but are in fact not. </p>
