        <h4>If we construct a material circle, measure its radius and circumference, and see if the ratio of these two
                lengths is equal to π , what shall we have done? We shall have made an experiment on the properties of
                the matter with which we constructed this round thing, and of that which the measure used was made.
                (Henri Poincaré, Science and Hypothesis, 1902)
